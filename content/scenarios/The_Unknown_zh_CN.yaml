  - [Image, content/gui/images/background/hr.png]
  - 在四天的风暴过后我们终于获得了喘息的机会。但是我们现在只剩下少许的食物与破损的船只。导航设备与航海图已经遗失了。
  - We have to come ashore soon. One of my jacks saw some birds hunting for fish, so land can't be far. Fortunately we always have some tools and boards onboard, so we can build some basic shelter.
  - '任务：

    寻找陆地和建立一个港口。'

- &FOOD_BOARDS
  - [Headline, 1740年11月22日]
  - [Image, content/gui/images/background/hr.png]
  - The port is built and a new hope arises. I am still worried about the next days… we are running out of food and lack basic building material.
  - We need to secure our basic needs to keep us alive. It is time to send people gathering food and lumber so that we can survive and build some shelter.
  - '任务：

    建立每个至少一个：

    *伐木工

    *渔夫

    *猎人

    收集5样食物和5块木板。'
  - [Pagebreak]
  - ''

- &TENTS
  - [Headline, 1740年11月25号]
  - [Image, content/gui/images/background/hr.png]
  - We have secured our basic needs of food and gathered some wood to continue the growth of our new settlement. Our people demand a place to live and exchange goods for their everyday needs.
  - It is time to build some tents to live in and a small main square to supply our citizens with goods.
  - '任务：

    建造一座主要广场和至少10间的帐篷。'
  - [Pagebreak]

- &GROW_SETTLEMENT
  - [Headline, 1740年12月1号]
  - [Image, content/gui/images/background/hr.png]
  - Finally we have enough to eat and a place to live again. My tent is not very comfortable but it keeps me dry and I have the feeling of having a roof over my head at night.
  - 'I have been researching the stars at night, but without my sea charts and instruments their meaning remains unknown. I have the feeling we will be stuck here for a while, so we''ll have to make the best of situation.

    We can only try to to build up a civilisation and find a way home…'
  - 'Task:

    Grow the village until you have at least 250 inhabitants and a positive balance.'

  - ''

- &WON
  - [Headline, 1745年8月27号]
  - [Image, content/gui/images/background/hr.png]
  - Our village is doing well, the city has grown to over 250 inhabitants. I have started getting used to my new home, but this island is too small to stay here forever.
  - We should load our ship and move out to find a bigger island offering room and resources for my people. I have created a basic navigational map again, using the stars I see at night. It is not perfect, but I hope it will suffice to return here.
  - 'Task:

    Contact the Unknown Horizons Team (www.unknown-horizons.org) and find out how you can contribute to making this scenario longer and better!'
